### Descendant

In the context of tree structures, descendants refer to all the nodes below a particular node in the hierarchy. This includes the children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and so on. Put simply, descendants are all the nodes that can be reached by following paths down from a specific node in the tree.

```
parent
├── child            <- Descendant to parent
│   └── grandchild   <- Descendant to parent
└── child            <- Descendant to parent
```

### Hints

In views, hints are comments that provide additional insights about the [descendants].

### Server-side Rendering (SSR) {#ssr}

Also, an abbriviation of Server-side Renderer (the tool). Server-side rendering is the concept of rendering views on the server before handing it to the client. It is dependent on the context since it renders data into the view.
